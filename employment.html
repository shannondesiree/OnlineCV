              <p style="font-size:small; float:right;"><i>Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo, Aug 2018-Jul 2022</i></p>
              </div>
              <p>Starting out, I had very little knowledge of tattooing and over the course of my 
                involvement, I witnessed first-hand just how prosperous, diverse and demanding the 
                industry truly is.</p> 
                <p>I began my career in Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo as recpetionist of a 
                busy, Glasgow-based studio with around 12 resident aritsts and 2 piercers and it was my job to
                fill each schedule through tattoo sales, social media marketing and by answering customer enquiries 
                on the front desk, on social media and through website form requests that accumulated in the company's 
                email inbox. This included making  amendments to diaries such as customer reschedule and artist holiday 
                requests. My previous experince in sales and customer service worked well for this role and contributed 
                to the promotion I recieved after just over a year of service. </p>
                <p>As regional manager, my tasks further pinpointed to resolving all customer and staff-related issues 
                  across the 7 UK-based company studios and the management of the 30+ stakeholders that consisted of 
                  artists, piercers and multiple office personnel to ensure the smooth daily running of the business. 
                  I focused on settling disputes among staff or clients, advocating techniques to promote a respectful and
                   motivated workplace. I embodied high customer service with the use of appropriate 
                   language and action, especially regarding refunds and complaints to ensure best case scenario outcome for 
                   both parties. My new role came with an aspect of project management where projects varied from themed 
                   walk-in days to national tattoo conventions. This included the preparation and application of large-scale 
                   ideas: VIP guest spots, conventions (Southampton Tattoo Show), themed tattoo flash walk-in days and staff 
                   training days. This involved the promotion and commercialisation of each event through social media marketing,
                   updating event information on the company's Shopify website and promotional products on the Wordpress platform. 
                  I was often responsible for contacting and confirming external suppliers and subcontractors for project-related 
                requirements as well as organising trasnportation for stakeholders. I had budgets to maintain and timelines to coincide 
              with in order to effectively manage each project. As regional manager, this could often </p>

                   <p>I was also responsible 
                for the coordination and development of company’s own tattoo and piercing apprenticeship 
                courses: recruitment, training and observing professional progres. 
                <h6>Company Recognition</h6>
                <p>I occassionally handled
                the generation of cash and finance sales via email, phone and in studio and am the company 
                record holder for highest value in tattoo deposits taken in one day (£3370), and one 
                month (£35740) until sales accumulated to >£250k over six-month period. </p>, I balanced 
                a multitude of tasks simultaneously dealing with customer, staff, supply or safety-related 
                issues efficiently and built strong internal and external relationships for successful 
                staff guidance and improved future practice.</p>

                full-time education working towards the PGDE qualification at Penicuik High 
                School. Here, I delivered BGE – Higher Biology and science lessons for pupils 
                aged 12-18 across 7 classes, with opportunities to teach non-science subjects 
                during cover classes, including IT. I developed meaningful and exciting lessons 
                by implementing pedagogical techniques and conducting practical experiments. I 
                updated S2 Science course to align with current national learning outcomes: refurbished 
                existing learning materials and linked key data to real-world examples for more 
                interactive, relatable and memorable lessons. Experienced 50/50 classroom/online 
                teaching working from home - significant practice in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint 
                and Teams, Google Classrooms, Docs, Forms and Zoom. I managed student behaviour 
                and academic progression achieving overall 75% pass rate, despite everchanging 
                end goals and conflicting professional advice during lockdown. I liaised closely 
                with additional support and guidance staff ensuring equal and fair learning for all. 
                I handled learning and other obstacles faced by my ADHD, ASD, Dyslexic, foreign 
                and visually impaired pupils with professionalism and compassion I honed 
                organisation and presentation skills as a practical and virtual educator 
                within unique coronavirus times and my resilience and adaptability proved key to 
                meeting the year’s teaching and learning requirements.</p>

                           ordering stock, handling mail and dispensing medication. I made key decisions regarding the health of 
                           many of our patients including providing medical advice - obtaining the relevant information and responding calmly to 
                           distinguish priority cases. I expanded my expeiernce and knoweledge by liaising with the resident veterinarian and referral

                                    <p>In 2015 I completed five months of zoological-based voluntary work in Asia with three 
                                      animal charities. I began with working as a <i>panda keeper</i> at the Giant Panda centre in Ya'an
                                      City, China - <b>CCRPGP</b> - the same centre where Edinburgh Zoo's Tian Tian and Yuan Gaun were 
                                      transferred from. With pandas being more threatening than they look, the work here mainly 
                                      consisted of cutting bamboo, preparing fruit cake, cleaning enlcosures and helping with enlcosure 
                                      maintenaince. At the end of my two weeks here, I was lucky to be invited to spend some hands-on time with some of 
                                      the panda cubs which was extremely rewarding. I arrived to <b>Phnom Tamao Wildlife Centre</b> in Cambodia 
                                      where I volunteered with the Free the Bears Sanctuary working with Malaysian sun and 
                                      Asiatic black bears. Coincidently, it was this centre that sourced the sun bears also residing in 
                                      Edinburgh Zoo! The work here was more strenuous and involved hammock-weaving, building enrichment tasks, 
                                      cleaning and feeding. I had the opporunity to observe click trainers with some of the bears, visit the bear 
                                       nursury that housed the cubs and work with many of the resuced bears with amputated limbs who had 
                                       been saved from the fate of old traditional medicines like bear paw soup - a cruel method many people 
                                       still believe to harbour natural healing powers. I then travelled to Thailand where I volunteered for 
                                       WFFT (Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand) in the <b>Phetchaburi</b> province where I gained husbandry experience for 
                                       rescued Asian elephants. I attended food harvests for banana trees to fields, used machetes to chop trees and loads onto trucks 
                                       as a major source of elephant food. I also made banana balls, hosed the animals and even walked some of the older residents. 
                                       I learned so much about the maintenance and around the clock care needed for these animals as well as knowledge of the specie
                                        themselves, local importance,  taxonomy, conservational status, and the typically saddening, historical background as to why 
                                      these animals are now so rarely found in the wild. I adore the work these charities do for the 
                                      welfare and husbandry of these species as I undertook this voluntary work as part of a travelling 
                                      expidition across Asia which brought its own benefits of broadening my cultural, lingual and geographical knowledge. </p>
                                      
                                      <p>For 10 days during December 2014 and January 2015 I completed a placement of voluntary work-based learning at <b>Seal Rescue 
                                      Ireland</b> as part of my third year at university where I was given the opportunity to be part of this non-profit organisation 
                                      that aimed to rescue, rehabilitate and releasing grey and common seals and seal pups. I got hands-on involved in preparing, 
                                      weighing, and feeding - both tube and fish-by-hand. I helped with cleaning and laundry, administering medicine, volunteer management
                                      and occassionally some clerical work. Learning about the two species of seal and the difference between them was 
                                      exciting and sometimes I was required to pass this information on to visitors coming to the 
                                      centre through presentational talks. I was glad that I chose to travel and do something different for this 
                                      experience and getting so close to wild, marine mammals was truly extraordinary. </p>

                                      <p>For a short period in 2014, I completed a term of voluntay work with the Scottish Owl Centre in Whitburn where gained experince in
                                        conducting educational talks and flying presentations to the public with the world’s largest collection of 
                                        trained owls. I took part in feeding the owls chicks as well as contributing to the rearing of several barn and tawny owlets. As a 
                                      fan of raptors, I really enjoyed this in-depth experince into owls and their care and informing the public of key species facts and population-affecting 
                                      factors was one of my greatest take-aways from this work. </p>

                                      <p>In June 2013, I travelled to South Africa and Swaziland to volunteer with the charity Volunteer Eco Students Abroad (VESA).  
                                      The program offered voluntary work in 3 categories: wildlife, children and construction. I worked with a variety of native animals 
                                      including African cheetahs, servals, crocodiles, wildebeest/gnu and Zebra where I was invoved in the breaking down of donated carcasses 
                                      to prepare food for the carnivores as well as chopping fruit and transporting water.
                                      As part of the voluntary work with children, I attended an orphanage and a school where we brought supplies and food, helped with homework 
                                      and played games with the kids. I painted, dug a trench and laid bricks as part of the construction voluntary work which was particularly 
                                      strenuous in African heat. The mixture of the three made my experience eye-openingly interesting, but the 
                                      wildlife experiences were my personal highlight. My time in Africa is where I first found my passion for travel and volutary work and 
                                      inspired many similar trips thereafter, and continuing to inpire more in later life I'm sure.</p>
