              <p style="font-size:small; float:right;"><i>Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo, Aug 2018-Jul 2022</i></p>
              </div>
              <p>Starting out, I had very little knowledge of tattooing and over the course of my 
                involvement, I witnessed first-hand just how prosperous, diverse and demanding the 
                industry truly is.</p> 
                <p>I began my career in Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo as recpetionist of a 
                busy, Glasgow-based studio with around 12 resident aritsts and 2 piercers and it was my job to
                fill each schedule through tattoo sales, social media marketing and by answering customer enquiries 
                on the front desk, on social media and through website form requests that accumulated in the company's 
                email inbox. This included making  amendments to diaries such as customer reschedule and artist holiday 
                requests. My previous experince in sales and customer service worked well for this role and contributed 
                to the promotion I recieved after just over a year of service. </p>
                <p>As regional manager, my tasks further pinpointed to resolving all customer and staff-related issues 
                  across the 7 UK-based company studios and the management of the 30+ stakeholders that consisted of 
                  artists, piercers and multiple office personnel to ensure the smooth daily running of the business. 
                  I focused on settling disputes among staff or clients, advocating techniques to promote a respectful and
                   motivated workplace. I embodied high customer service with the use of appropriate 
                   language and action, especially regarding refunds and complaints to ensure best case scenario outcome for 
                   both parties. My new role came with an aspect of project management where projects varied from themed 
                   walk-in days to national tattoo conventions. This included the preparation and application of large-scale 
                   ideas: VIP guest spots, conventions (Southampton Tattoo Show), themed tattoo flash walk-in days and staff 
                   training days. This involved the promotion and commercialisation of each event through social media marketing,
                   updating event information on the company's Shopify website and promotional products on the Wordpress platform. 
                  I was often responsible for contacting and confirming external suppliers and subcontractors for project-related 
                requirements as well as organising trasnportation for stakeholders. I had budgets to maintain and timelines to coincide 
              with in order to effectively manage each project. As regional manager, this could often </p>

                   <p>I was also responsible 
                for the coordination and development of company’s own tattoo and piercing apprenticeship 
                courses: recruitment, training and observing professional progres. 
                <h6>Company Recognition</h6>
                <p>I occassionally handled
                the generation of cash and finance sales via email, phone and in studio and am the company 
                record holder for highest value in tattoo deposits taken in one day (£3370), and one 
                month (£35740) until sales accumulated to >£250k over six-month period. </p>, I balanced 
                a multitude of tasks simultaneously dealing with customer, staff, supply or safety-related 
                issues efficiently and built strong internal and external relationships for successful 
                staff guidance and improved future practice.</p>

                full-time education working towards the PGDE qualification at Penicuik High 
                School. Here, I delivered BGE – Higher Biology and science lessons for pupils 
                aged 12-18 across 7 classes, with opportunities to teach non-science subjects 
                during cover classes, including IT. I developed meaningful and exciting lessons 
                by implementing pedagogical techniques and conducting practical experiments. I 
                updated S2 Science course to align with current national learning outcomes: refurbished 
                existing learning materials and linked key data to real-world examples for more 
                interactive, relatable and memorable lessons. Experienced 50/50 classroom/online 
                teaching working from home - significant practice in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint 
                and Teams, Google Classrooms, Docs, Forms and Zoom. I managed student behaviour 
                and academic progression achieving overall 75% pass rate, despite everchanging 
                end goals and conflicting professional advice during lockdown. I liaised closely 
                with additional support and guidance staff ensuring equal and fair learning for all. 
                I handled learning and other obstacles faced by my ADHD, ASD, Dyslexic, foreign 
                and visually impaired pupils with professionalism and compassion I honed 
                organisation and presentation skills as a practical and virtual educator 
                within unique coronavirus times and my resilience and adaptability proved key to 
                meeting the year’s teaching and learning requirements.</p>

                           In reception, I greeted clients and patients with a friendly and welcoming attitude; booking appointments, answering the phone, 
                           ordering stock, handling mail and dispensing medication. I made key decisions regarding the health of 
                           many of our patients including providing medical advice - obtaining the relevant information and responding calmly to 
                           distinguish priority cases. I expanded my expeiernce and knoweledge by liaising with the resident veterinarian and referral

                                    <p>In 2015 I completed five months of zoological-based voluntary work in Asia with three 
                                      animal charities. I began with working as a <i>panda keeper</i> at the Giant Panda centre in Ya'an
                                      City, China - CCRPGP - the same centre where Edinburgh Zoo's Tian Tian and Yuan Gaun were 
                                      transferred from. With pandas being more threatening than they look, the work here mainly 
                                      consisted of cutting bamboo, preparing fruit cake, cleaning enlcosures and helping with enlcosure 
                                      maintenaince. At the end, we were lucky to be invited to spend some hands-on time with some of 
                                      the panda cubs which was extremely rewarding. I arrived to Phnom Tamao Wildlife Centre in Cambodia 
                                      where I volunteered with the Free the Bears Sanctuary working with Malaysian sun and 
                                      Asiatic black bears. Coincidently, it was this centre that sourced the sun bears also residing in 
                                      Edinburgh Zoo! The work here was more strenuous and involved hammock-weaving, building enrichment tasks, 
                                      cleaning and feeding. I had the opporunity to observe click trainers with some of the bears, visit the bear 
                                       nursury that housed the cubs and work with many of the resuced bears with amputated limbs who had 
                                       been saved from the fate of old traditional medicines like bear paw soup - a cruel method many people 
                                       still believe to harbour natural healing powers. I then travelled to Thailand where I volunteered for 
                                       WFFT (Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand) in Chandg-mai where I gained husbandry experience for Asian 
                                      elephants. I went out to banana tree fields and harvested the trunks for the elephants. We made banana balls,
                                    hosed the animals and even walked some of the older residents. </p> 
                                      <p></p>I learned so much about the maintenance and around the clock care needed 
                                      for these animals as well as knowledge of the species themselves, local importance, 
                                      taxonomy, conservational status, and the usually sad historical background as to why 
                                      they are now so rarely found in the wild. I adore the work these charities do for the 
                                      welfare and husbandry of these species, and as a result I am confident with pursuing 
                                      my dream of dedicating my life to benefit animals. Furthermore, travelling across Asia 
                                      itself broadened my mind in many other cultural ways. For 10 days during December 2014 
                                      and January 2015 I completed a placement of voluntary work-based learning at Seal Rescue 
                                      Ireland. As part of one of my third year modules at university I was given the opportunity 
                                      to be part of this non-profit organisation with the aim of rescuing, rehabilitating and 
                                      releasing common and grey seal pups. The tasks I undertook consisted of preparing, weighing, 
                                      and distributing feeds, cleaning and laundry, restraints for tube-feeds, administering medicine, 
                                      and clerical work. Learning about the two species of seal and the difference between them was 
                                      exciting and sometimes I was required to pass this information on to visitors coming to the 
                                      centre through talks. I was glad that I chose to travel and do something different for this 
                                      experience and getting so close to wild, marine mammals was truly extraordinary. 
                                      In June 2013, I travelled to South Africa and Swaziland to volunteer with the charity VESA.  
                                      I worked with a variety of native animals including cheetahs, servals, crocodiles and alligators, 
                                      as well as working at an orphanage, a school, and on a construction site. The mixture of the three 
                                      of these widened the help I provided making my experience very interesting, however it was the 
                                      animal work that appealed to me most. The two weeks here lit a spark to my love for working with 
                                      animals and inspired my more recent voluntary trip to Asia. 
                                      Additionally, I have also completed short term volunteer work with the Scottish Owl Centre where 
                                      I conducted talks and flying presentations to the public with the world’s largest collection of 
                                      trained owls as well as feeding and contributing to the rearing of several owlets.
