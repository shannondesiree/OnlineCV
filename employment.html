              <p style="font-size:small; float:right;"><i>Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo, Aug 2018-Jul 2022</i></p>
              </div>
              <p>Starting out, I had very little knowledge of tattooing and over the course of my 
                involvement, I witnessed first-hand just how prosperous, diverse and demanding the 
                industry truly is.</p> 
                <p>I began my career in Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo as recpetionist of a 
                busy, Glasgow-based studio with around 12 resident aritsts and 2 piercers and it was my job to
                fill each schedule through tattoo sales, social media marketing and by answering customer enquiries 
                on the front desk, on social media and through website form requests that accumulated in the company's 
                email inbox. This included making  amendments to diaries such as customer reschedule and artist holiday 
                requests. My previous experince in sales and customer service worked well for this role and contributed 
                to the promotion I recieved after just over a year of service. </p>
                <p>As regional manager, my tasks further pinpointed to resolving all customer and staff-related issues 
                  across the 7 UK-based company studios and the management of the 30+ stakeholders that consisted of 
                  artists, piercers and multiple office personnel to ensure the smooth daily running of the business. 
                  I focused on settling disputes among staff or clients, advocating techniques to promote a respectful and
                   motivated workplace. I embodied high customer service with the use of appropriate 
                   language and action, especially regarding refunds and complaints to ensure best case scenario outcome for 
                   both parties. My new role came with an aspect of project management where projects varied from themed 
                   walk-in days to national tattoo conventions. This included the preparation and application of large-scale 
                   ideas: VIP guest spots, conventions (Southampton Tattoo Show), themed tattoo flash walk-in days and staff 
                   training days. This involved the promotion and commercialisation of each event through social media marketing,
                   updating event information on the company's Shopify website and promotional products on the Wordpress platform. 
                  I was often responsible for contacting and confirming external suppliers and subcontractors for project-related 
                requirements as well as organising trasnportation for stakeholders. I had budgets to maintain and timelines to coincide 
              with in order to effectively manage each project. As regional manager, this could often </p>
                   <h6>Valuable Experience</h6>
                   <p>I was also responsible 
                for the coordination and development of company’s own tattoo and piercing apprenticeship 
                courses: recruitment, training and observing professional progres. Laser technician.
                <h6>Company Recognition</h6>
                <p>I occassionally handled
                the generation of cash and finance sales via email, phone and in studio and am the company 
                record holder for highest value in tattoo deposits taken in one day (£3370), and one 
                month (£35740) until sales accumulated to >£250k over six-month period. </p>, I balanced 
                a multitude of tasks simultaneously dealing with customer, staff, supply or safety-related 
                issues efficiently and built strong internal and external relationships for successful 
                staff guidance and improved future practice.</p>

              <h6><b>Secondary Biology Teacher</b></h>
              <p style="font-size:small; float:right;"><i>Midlothian Council, Aug 2020 - Aug 2021</i></p>
              </div>
              <p>The probationary teaching year consisted of a full-time teaching position where I was 
                allocated to <i>Penicuik High School</i> along with full-time education whilst I worked towards the PGDE qualification 
                and my Full Registration Teacher status. I had previously gained some practical experinece from placements at 
                <i>Saint Andrew's Roman Catholic Academy</i> and <i>Louden Academy</i> and much of what I had practiced here proved very 
                useful. Over the year, I delivered BGE (Broad General Education) science – Higher Biology 
                lessons for pupils aged 12-18 across 7 classes, with occasional opportunities to teach non-science subjects 
                during cover classes, including IT. Furthermore, I updated S2 Science course to align with current national learning outcomes 
                where I refurbished the existing learning materials and linked key data from the syllabus to real-world examples for more 
                interactive, relatable and memorable lessons.</p>
                <p>Naturally, I embraced Penicuik’s PRIDE (Participation Respect Inclusion Determination 
                Excellence) vision and their PAME (Progress Achievment Merit Excellence) success-measuring system and both were 
                corroborated through my practice with classroom notices and verbal prompts. </p>
                <p>I demonstrated my personal organisation by separating and filing away pupil work into designated 
                class group boxes/files, updating assessment, absence and homework records, utilising yearly planners and by maintaining an orderly room 
                and desk. By keeping organised, I was able to free up time to devote to other tasks, find information and resources faster and reduce 
                distractions within lessons.</p>
                <p>I developed meaningful and exciting lessons by implementing pedagogical techniques and conducting practical experiments 
                  and with the range of abled learners, being flexible and tactical in my use of techniques to deliver lessons was important 
                  in order to meet the needs of all my pupils. As an artistic person who takes pride in her work, I enjoyed creating my own resources, 
                  home-works and assessments and maintained accuracy in my practice by referring to benchmarks of the CfE and course 
                 specifications of SQA. I used appropriate pedagogy strategies that worked mutualistically with modern-day education principals 
                such as differentiation and IDL (Inter-Disciplinary Learning) where was meticulous and careful in my lesson planning, 
                activities and use of formative assessment was required. I implemented a number of pedagogies to promote worthwhile learning and 
                a more positive and long-lasting embedment effect in young people, conveying this in my use of software and videos, 
                group work, presentations, posters, experiments, quizzes, flashcards, LOtC (Learning Outside of the Classroom), 
                online and digital tasks, LI (Learning Intentions) and SC (Success Criteria), whiteboards and previous pupil work. 
                As an advocate of STEAM (Science Technology Engineering Arts and Mathematics) eductaion, I always pushed for cross-curricular opportunities in my classroom where possible, channeling IDL 
                into my classroom by giving pupils opportunities to express themselves creatively and imaginatively 
                through the different branches of STEAM. </p>
                <p>I valued the importance of making learning accessible and fun, particularly when it came 
                  to ASN (Additional Support Needs) pupils. I facilitated personal learning programmes that delivered effective learning for all pupils, 
                  accounting ACEs (Adverse Childhood Experiences) in the guidance of troublesome or misunderstood children. I 
                  adjusted my pedagogy, kinesics and intonation to personify the needs of behaviourally challenging or emotional children. 
                  I ensured that my teaching style supported GIRFEC (Getting It Right For Every Child) and remained inclusive by adjusting 
                  lessons to the pupils in front of me - whether this be to confront any ASN, behaviour-related or exceptional circumstances. 
                  My experinece of teacing ASN extends across learning difficulties like dyslexia and dyscalculia, disabilities such as cerebral 
                  palsy, ASD (Autistic Spectrum Disorder) and blindness, as well as the gifted and ESOL (English to Speakers of Other Languages) 
                  where I differentiated for ASN pupils accordingly and assessed learning via formative assessment.
                  With the help of trial and error, school disciplinary codes and patience, I effectively and efficiently managed both 
                  behaviourally, emotionally and academically demanding pupils and variety of problematic classes, quickly responding to challenging 
                  situations with professionalism, empathy and firmness. Inclusion was an education policy that I was especially passionate about as 
                  it adopts a support for all movement and embeds equity and empowerment in young people. I used inclusive policies 
                  such as Education Scotland's CIRCLE resource framework and by treating my pupils fairly and with respect 
                  to promote inclusivity in my classroom, giving students a voice and equal opportunities for success. I 
                  embraced diversity and showed intolerance towards exclusive behaviour to nurture a welcoming, safe and secure
                   classroom ethos. My classroom offered encouragement to debate and sharing of emotions to shape patient, listening 
                   and confident characters. When pupils wanted to talk to me about personal issues, I approached these matters with sensitivity 
                  and open ears, responding appropriately by either disclosing to guidance, sharing common knowledge 
                  or by simply listening. Over the course of the year, I made continuous efforts to break down any barriers
                  that inhibited a child’s ability to work effectively in my class which promoted positive pupil relationships 
                 and led to improved attainment.</p>
                
                <p> I had a whirlwind of experiences from the children I met 
                  and their unique backgrounds to the daily and unforeseen obstructions which hinder embedded learning. I 
                  gained a deeper understanding of the purpose and significance of teachers and schools coalescing for 
                  the benefit of learners. Undergoing action research is a way to individually hone this common goal for 
                  educators and I researched and focused on the impact of pupil confidence on their ability 
                  to succeed in science. I decided on this topic as not only had I witnessed first-hand how much of a fragile 
                  and fluctuating concept confidence is, but how extremely central it is in the push for health and wellbeing, 
                  inclusion and the CfE’s four capacities. I studied research reports from other professionals and conducted 
                  a survey among a handful of pupils who fitted the confident and not-confident child profiles. Post evaluation, 
                  I was able to apply my findings to improve my pedagogy and am keen to indulge this further in this type of continued 
                  professional development. My experience of parents’ evenings confirmed the importance of working in partnership with 
                  parents and other professionals to pursue the common goal of educators.
                  I regulated my progression and success by continually self-evaluating 
                  and reflecting and with additional continued professional development where I gained knowledge through behavioural, 
                  pedagogical and research-based seminars and colloquies. Furthermore, I attended school and local authority moderation events 
                  for both the SQA (Scottish Qualificiations Authority) and Dart National 5 and Higher assessments, gaining a solid knowledge of 
                  the Scottish curricular framework for education, addressing any  areas of uncertainty by observing lessons, picking the brains 
                  of my colleagues or locating relevant textual guidance. I was vigilant to clarify updates and seek advice 
                from the SQA and Government in order to stay mindful of current developments, ensuring my teaching remained effective and in-line with other 
                professional bodies. I recognised the importance and responsibility of all teachers to plan learning and assess progress through whole-school 
                delivery of the literacy, numeracy and health and wellbeing outcomes. I demonstrated this by building positive relationships with my pupils, 
                reiterating problem-solving skills and conditioning literacy through an array of exercises. </p>

                <p>In summary, I managed student behaviour and academic progression achieving overall 75% pass rate, despite everchanging 
                  end goals and conflicting professional advice during lockdown. I worked with differing sizes of 
                  science departments, partaken in team and co-teaching, attended and engaged in assessment reporting at school level. I liaised with 
                  other bodies within school institutions such as the ASL (Additional Support for Learning), SMT (Senior Management Team) and guidance team,
                   ensuring equal and fair learning for all, handling learning and other obstacles faced by my ADHD, ASD, Dyslexic, foreign 
                  and visually impaired pupils with professionalism, compassion and the use of tested pedagogical techniques. I honed 
                  organisation and presentation skills as a practical and virtual educator 
                  within unique coronavirus times where schools conducted 50/50 classroom/online teaching, mastering my own
                  practice in software tools such as Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint and Teams, Google Classrooms, Docs, Forms and Zoom. Looking 
                  back, my resilience and adaptability proved key to meeting the year’s teaching and learning requirements.</p>

              <p>I hosted 3, 4 and 5 hour boat tours in the Inner Hebrides as a wildlife guide, maintaining

                relocated to Oban and gained skippering experience. This temporary position involved working on a small 
                boat during the summer months which operated wildlife tours around the Inner Hebrides. I was responsible for 
                the safety and comfort of the passengers on board as well as spotting local wildlife such as 
                white-tailed eagles, dolphins, whales, seabirds, otters, wild goats and deer and then presenting

                    months) were my top accomplishments here. I was also invited to attend 
                    prestigious events like Countryfile Live, Scottish Nature Awards and the 
                    Royal Highland Show based on my performance and enjoyed employing my sales 
                    strength to a cause I genuinely cared for. As an MDO, it was my job to attend 
                    different venues and events across Scotland to partake in engaging and emotive 
                    conversations with the public with the aid of a nature- themed stall. My goal was 
                    to get people to understand and recognise the UK nature crisis and persuade them 
                    to become actively involved either by buying a pin badge, making their garden more 
                    nature friendly, or contributing financially through the RSPB’s membership scheme. 
                    I was talented at this and became the top saleswoman of memberships in Scotland.</p>

                              empolyment. This then entitled me of being responsible of opening the store, returns, directly managing requests of those at 
                              higher ranks in the workforce, cashing up and closing the store as well as supervising and instructing fellow sales assistants, 
                              as well as greeting and assisting customers as a sales assistant. I feel as though this role suited me well as I am a natural 
                              leader and capable of managing tasks on my own. This position tested my abilities to work well under pressure with a time scale 
                              and perform daily and transactional routines accurately with confidence.  The work I have carried out here has sculpted my 
                              understanding of the product and personal relation which I find are key concepts of successful salesmanship, as well as directly 
                              working with large amounts of money and constantly in the presence of buyers both my trustworthiness and customer service is now 
                              to an exceptional standard.</p>

                                <p>For 13 months I worked as an Impact Team Member of Hollister Co. Not only did this retail based employment involve continuous 
                                  communication with customers and quickly replenishing store shelves on the sales floor but also working in the stock room as 
                                  part of a team preparing and individually maintaining the work load given to me. This opportunity widened my retail knowledge 
                                  and furthered my management, leadership and customer service skills.</p>

                                    <h6><b>Voluntary Work</b></h>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>In 2015 I completed six weeks of zoological-based voluntary work in Asia with three 
                                      animal charities. I began with working as a <i>panda keeper</i> at the Giant Panda centre in Ya'an
                                      City, China - <b>CCRPGP</b> - the same centre where Edinburgh Zoo's Tian Tian and Yuan Gaun were 
                                      transferred from. With pandas being more threatening than they look, the work here mainly 
                                      consisted of cutting bamboo, preparing fruit cake, cleaning enlcosures and helping with enlcosure 
                                      maintenaince. At the end of my two weeks here, I was lucky to be invited to spend some hands-on time with some of 
                                      the panda cubs which was extremely rewarding. I arrived to <b>Phnom Tamao Wildlife Centre</b> in Cambodia 
                                      where I volunteered with the Free the Bears Sanctuary working with Malaysian sun and 
                                      Asiatic black bears. Coincidently, it was this centre that sourced the sun bears also residing in 
                                      Edinburgh Zoo! The work here was more strenuous and involved hammock-weaving, building enrichment tasks, 
                                      cleaning and feeding. I had the opporunity to observe click trainers with some of the bears, visit the bear 
                                       nursury that housed the cubs and work with many of the resuced bears with amputated limbs who had 
                                       been saved from the fate of old traditional medicines like bear paw soup - a cruel method many people 
                                       still believe to harbour natural healing powers. I then travelled to Thailand where I volunteered for 
                                       WFFT (Wildlife Friends Foundation Thailand) in the <b>Phetchaburi</b> province where I gained husbandry experience for 
                                       rescued Asian elephants. I attended food harvests for banana trees to fields, used machetes to chop trees and loads onto trucks 
                                       as a major source of elephant food. I also made banana balls, hosed the animals and even walked some of the older residents. 
                                       I learned so much about the maintenance and around the clock care needed for these animals as well as knowledge of the specie
                                        themselves, local importance,  taxonomy, conservational status, and the typically saddening, historical background as to why 
                                      these animals are now so rarely found in the wild. I adore the work these charities do for the 
                                      welfare and husbandry of these species as I undertook this voluntary work as part of a travelling 
                                      expidition across Asia which brought its own benefits of broadening my cultural, lingual and geographical knowledge. </p>
                                      
                                      <p>For 10 days during December 2014 and January 2015 I completed a placement of voluntary work-based learning at <b>Seal Rescue 
                                      Ireland</b> as part of my third year at university where I was given the opportunity to be part of this non-profit organisation 
                                      that aimed to rescue, rehabilitate and releasing grey and common seals and seal pups. I got hands-on involved in preparing, 
                                      weighing, and feeding - both tube and fish-by-hand. I helped with cleaning and laundry, administering medicine, volunteer management
                                      and occassionally some clerical work. Learning about the two species of seal and the difference between them was 
                                      exciting and sometimes I was required to pass this information on to visitors coming to the 
                                      centre through presentational talks. I was glad that I chose to travel and do something different for this 
                                      experience and getting so close to wild, marine mammals was truly extraordinary. </p>

                                      <p>For a short period in Summer 2014, I completed a term of voluntay work with the <b>Scottish Owl Centre</b> in Whitburn where gained experince in
                                        conducting educational talks and flying presentations to the public with the world’s largest collection of 
                                        trained owls. I took part in feeding the owls chicks as well as contributing to the rearing of several barn and tawny owlets. As a 
                                      fan of raptors, I really enjoyed this in-depth experince into owls and their care and informing the public of key species facts and population-affecting 
                                      factors was one of my greatest take-aways from this work. </p>

                                      <p>In June 2013, I travelled to various locations in <b>South Africa</b> and <b>Swaziland</b> to volunteer with the charity Volunteer Eco Students Abroad (VESA).  
                                      The program offered voluntary work in 3 categories: wildlife, children and construction. I worked with a variety of native animals 
                                      including African cheetahs, servals, crocodiles, wildebeest/gnu and Zebra where I was invoved in the breaking down of donated carcasses 
                                      to prepare food for the carnivores as well as chopping fruit and transporting water.
                                      As part of the voluntary work with children, we worked with local kids in the Khula village and as there were next to zero teachers and tutored them on maths and English. 
                                      I attended an orphanage and a school where we brought supplies and food, helped with homework and played games with the kids. I painted, dug a trench and laid bricks 
                                      as part of the construction voluntary work which was particularly strenuous in African heat. The mixture of the three made my experience eye-openingly 
                                      interesting, but the wildlife experiences were my personal highlight. My time in Africa is where I first found my passion for travel and volutary work and 
                                      inspired many similar trips thereafter and continuing to inpire more in later life, I'm sure!</p>

                                      <p>Furthermore, I was a member of the RAF Cadets from Feb'08 - April'11 and attended twice a week. Through this time I accomplished many activities 
                                        e.g. ab-sailing, archery, rifle shooting, attended two annual camps: Northern Ireland and Cyprus, competed in several regional competitions: 
                                        drill, swimming, netball, hockey, football, cross country and athletics, I also spent a weekend at the outdoors activity centre PGL, achieved and was
                                         certified for over 150 hours of voluntary community work and took part in the Bobath Cycle for charity in Jan’09 and Jan'10.</p>
