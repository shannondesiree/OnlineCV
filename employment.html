              <p style="font-size:small; float:right;"><i>Rock 'n' Roll Tattoo, Aug 2018-Jul 2022</i></p>
              </div>
              <p>Starting out, I had very little knowledge of tattooing and over the course of my 
                involvement, I witnessed first-hand just how prosperous, diverse and demanding the 
                industry truly is. As regional manager, my tasks were to resolve issues across 7 
                company studios. I was responsible for the management of 30+ stakeholders – artists, 
                piercers and office personnel - settling disputes and advocating techniques to promote 
                a respectful and motivated workplace. I covered the maintenance of high customer 
                service with appropriate language and action, especially regarding refunds and 
                complaints to ensure best case scenario outcome. My role included the preparation 
                and application of large-scale company projects: VIP guest spots, conventions 
                (Southampton Tattoo Show), themed walk-in days and training days. I aided the promotion 
                of projects and regular discounted offers with social media marketing, updating 
                products and company website on Shopify and Wordpress platforms. I was also responsible 
                for the coordination and development of company’s own tattoo and piercing apprenticeship 
                courses: recruitment, training and observing professional progres. I occassionally handled
                the generation of cash and finance sales via email, phone and in studio and am the company 
                record holder for highest value in tattoo deposits taken in one day (£3370), and one 
                month (£35740) until sales accumulated to >£250k over six-month period. Here, I balanced 
                a multitude of tasks simultaneously dealing with customer, staff, supply or safety-related 
                issues efficiently and built strong internal and external relationships for successful 
                staff guidance and improved future practice.</p>

              <p>Probationary teaching year consisted of a full-time teaching position and 
                full-time education working towards the PGDE qualification at Penicuik High 
                School. Here, I delivered BGE – Higher Biology and science lessons for pupils 
                aged 12-18 across 7 classes, with opportunities to teach non-science subjects 
                during cover classes, including IT. I developed meaningful and exciting lessons 
                by implementing pedagogical techniques and conducting practical experiments. I 
                updated S2 Science course to align with current national learning outcomes: refurbished 
                existing learning materials and linked key data to real-world examples for more 
                interactive, relatable and memorable lessons. Experienced 50/50 classroom/online 
                teaching working from home - significant practice in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint 
                and Teams, Google Classrooms, Docs, Forms and Zoom. I managed student behaviour 
                and academic progression achieving overall 75% pass rate, despite everchanging 
                end goals and conflicting professional advice during lockdown. I liaised closely 
                with additional support and guidance staff ensuring equal and fair learning for all. 
                I handled learning and other obstacles faced by my ADHD, ASD, Dyslexic, foreign 
                and visually impaired pupils with professionalism and compassion I honed 
                organisation and presentation skills as a practical and virtual educator 
                within unique coronavirus times and my resilience and adaptability proved key to 
                meeting the year’s teaching and learning requirements.</p>

              <p>I hosted 3, 4 and 5 hour boat tours in the Inner Hebrides as a wildlife guide, maintaining 
                the safety and wellbeing of passengers, educating them on local wildlife, providing 5 star 
                hospitality and mooring the boat. Responding to the skipper’s instructions during adverse 
                conditions were critical to this role with photography and editing (Photoshop/Lightroom) 
                being other important areas of business. I was rewarded with stunning Scottish wildlife, 
                relocated to Oban and gained skippering experience.</p>

                    months) were my top accomplishments here. I was also invited to attend 
                    prestigious events like Countryfile Live, Scottish Nature Awards and the

                                    <h6><b>Voluntary Work</b></h>
                                    </div>
                                    <p>In 2015 I completed five months of zoological-based voluntary work in Asia. The work 
                                      I did here was exclusively to benefit charities that dealt with endangered animals – 
                                      specifically giant pandas at CCRCGP near Ya’an city in China, Malaysian sun and 
                                      Asiatic black bears at the Free the Bears centre in Phnom Tamao, Cambodia, and Asian 
                                      elephants with WFFT in Thailand. Coincidently, the pandas and sun bears in Edinburgh 
                                      Zoo have both come from these very centres. A combination of the climate and labour 
                                      made working very challenging, but nonetheless I found the whole experience extremely 
                                      rewarding. I learned so much about the maintenance and around the clock care needed 
                                      for these animals as well as knowledge of the species themselves, local importance, 
                                      taxonomy, conservational status, and the usually sad historical background as to why 
                                      they are now so rarely found in the wild. I adore the work these charities do for the 
                                      welfare and husbandry of these species, and as a result I am confident with pursuing 
                                      my dream of dedicating my life to benefit animals. Furthermore, travelling across Asia 
                                      itself broadened my mind in many other cultural ways. For 10 days during December 2014 
                                      and January 2015 I completed a placement of voluntary work-based learning at Seal Rescue 
                                      Ireland. As part of one of my third year modules at university I was given the opportunity 
                                      to be part of this non-profit organisation with the aim of rescuing, rehabilitating and 
                                      releasing common and grey seal pups. The tasks I undertook consisted of preparing, weighing, 
                                      and distributing feeds, cleaning and laundry, restraints for tube-feeds, administering medicine, 
                                      and clerical work. Learning about the two species of seal and the difference between them was 
                                      exciting and sometimes I was required to pass this information on to visitors coming to the 
                                      centre through talks. I was glad that I chose to travel and do something different for this 
                                      experience and getting so close to wild, marine mammals was truly extraordinary. 
                                      In June 2013, I travelled to South Africa and Swaziland to volunteer with the charity VESA.  
                                      I worked with a variety of native animals including cheetahs, servals, crocodiles and alligators, 
                                      as well as working at an orphanage, a school, and on a construction site. The mixture of the three 
                                      of these widened the help I provided making my experience very interesting, however it was the 
                                      animal work that appealed to me most. The two weeks here lit a spark to my love for working with 
                                      animals and inspired my more recent voluntary trip to Asia. 
                                      Additionally, I have also completed short term volunteer work with the Scottish Owl Centre where 
                                      I conducted talks and flying presentations to the public with the world’s largest collection of 
                                      trained owls as well as feeding and contributing to the rearing of several owlets.
