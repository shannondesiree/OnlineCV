            <h5><b>PDA Software Development SCQF Level 6 - PASS</b></h5>
            <p style="font-size:small;"><i>Glasgow Clyde College, 2023</i></p>
            <p>With the equivalency of an Advance Higher, the PDA involved different aspects that 
                I hadn't yet come across in my online studies including foreign computer languages 
                like Java and extensive planning principles relating to lifecycle models and project 
                management. The course covered programming principles, algorithms, project management and 
                came with a focus on Agile methodologies, the Waterfall software development lifecycle 
                model and Java programming. I learned to navigate new softwares like ProjectLibre and 
                work in new IDEs like IntelliJ until planning and implementing a real-world project in Java. </p>
                <h5><b>CS50: Intro to Computer Science</b></h5>
                <p style="font-size:small;"><i>Harvard Online vie EdX, 2022</i></p>
                <p>After reading great reviews on thise course as a wise and worthy first step into the vast 
                world of computer science, I was determined to learn something I had zero prior knowledge of 
                and commit to the level of self-discipline that was required. The course introduced programming in 
                a clear and understandable way, starting from basic programming concepts using C. This progressed on to
                higher level programming languages such as Python, HTML and JavaScript and how they have evolved from more machine-friendly 
                languages like C. PHP databases, SQL and CSS were also part of the syllabus which required the submission 
                of over 30 coding assignements and a final project. I used JavaScript with HTML and CSS to create a point-of-sale system which can be 
                viewed on my Github. </p>
            <h5><b>PGDE Secondary Biology with Science - PASS</b></h5>
            <p style="font-size:small"><i>Univeristy of the West of Scotland, 2020</i></p>
            <p>I undertook the Post Graduate Diploma in Education in Secondary Biology with 
                Science to become a secondary teacher of biology and science. The course 
                duration was one year and involved 3 separate, full-time 2, 5 and 6 week placements 
                respectively. My placement schools were <i>Louden Academy</i> and <i>Saint Andrews RC Academy</i>. 
                Over the course, I researched pupil confidence and the pverty-related 
                attainment gap by means of two dissertaions which, with my performance on placement, 
                contributed to my formal assessment of the program. My experience was particularly
                challenging due to lockdown where educators at my placement establishment faced the 
                challenges of distant and online learning for the first time. After obtaining my PGDE, I carried 
                my initial teacher training probationary year at Penicuik High School in Midlothian where, after an academic
                year, I gained my full registration teacher status. </p>
            <h5><b>BSc Applied Bioscience and Zoology (sandwich Degree) - PASS</b></h5>
            <p style="font-size:small"><i>Unitversity of the West of Scotland, 2015</i></p>
            <p>As an animal lover, I really enjoyed learning more about the natural world in this course. It 
                covered animal physiology, behaviour and taxonomy as well as specialist modules such as Entomology and Parasitology.
                The course included a short but hands-on excursion to Millport where we able to identify and research 
                a wide variety living species in person. The program also allowed for animal-related work experience where I 
                chose to volunteer at a seal rescue centre in Ireland for 10 days. My final thesis was concentrated to microplastics and I 
                thoroughly enjoyed my professionally-related experineces within the tourism, veterinary and charity-based industries. 
                Furthermore, this degree ultimately inspired a lot of my current hobbies including birdwatching and wildlife photography, 
                and influenced my decision to travel exotic places, witnesses amazing earth and her aniamls.
