            </div>
            <p>With the equivalency of an Advance Higher, the 12-week PDA involved different aspects that 
                I hadn't yet come across in my online studies to explore computer science - including foreign computer languages 
                like Java and extensive planning principles relating to software development lifecycles and project
                management. The course covered general <b>programming principles, algorithms, and data handling</b> 
                and came with a focus on the <b>Agile methodologies vs the Waterfall</b> SDLC 
                model using <b>Java</b> as the primary programming language. I learned to navigate new software tools like Project Libre and 
                work within new Integrated Development Environments like IntelliJ both as an individal and as part of a team to plan and 
                implementing a variety of real-world projects in Java to contribute towards the course assessment. 
                I qualified with a PDA (Professional Development Award) in Software Development at SCQF Level 7 in March 2023. </p>

                </div>
                <p>After exploring my options to begin my journey to becoming a software developer, I identified the CS50 online 10-week course from
                  Harvard via EdX as a wise and worthy first step for beginners into the vast world of computer science. I realised this was the career
                   choice for me and that this could provide what I was looking for from a career after various encounters with likeminded people and some 
                   industry research. The time I took to reflect on my own character and where and what I would excel in was my leading motivation to undertake this 
                   specific course and I have been climbing the mountain of ever since. The course introduced programming in 
                a clear and understandable way, building a foundation with the machine-friendly language of <b>C</b> and expaining its evolution to 
                 the higher level programming languages such as <b>Python, HTML and JavaScript</b>. I learned about <b>search/sort algorithms</b> and concepts like 
                 <b>recursion, debugging, arrays, memory, conditoinal statements, data types, operators</b> and <b>loops</b>. The course also touched on <b>PHP </b>and <b>databases, SQL, CSS</b> 
                 and <b>Cyber Security</b>. The syllabus required the submission of over 30 coding assignements and a final project where I used JavaScript with HTML 
                 and CSS to create a point-of-sale system as seen via my Github profile. </p>

                    <h6><b>PGDE Secondary Biology with Science - PASS</b></h>
                    <p style="font-size:small; float:right;"><i>Univeristy of the West of Scotland, 2020</i></p>
                </div>
            <p>I undertook the Post Graduate Diploma in Education, qualifying with a PASS in Secondary Biology Teaching with Science 
              in 2020. The course duration was one year and involved part class attendance at University and part placement on school where I undertook 
               3 separate, full-time 2, 5 and 6 week placements respectively at <i>Louden Academy</i> and 
               <i>Saint Andrews RC Academy</i>. This is where I initially began perfecting my planning and presenting skills as an educator and 
               over the course as part of the Univeristy Diploma, <b>I carried out real-time research into pupil confidence and the poverty-related 
                attainment gap</b> and used my findings to contribute towards dissertaions which, combined with my performance on placement, 
                contributed to my formal overall assessment of the program. I developed an aptitude for different hardware used to deliver course content 
                to pupils like SmartBoards and the software tools that went with them, mastering my competency in Microsoft Excel, PowerPoint, Office and Word. 
                My experience was particularly adverse due to the coronavirus pandemic where staff at my placement establishment faced the 
                difficulties of distant and online teaching for the first time. In University, I learned about the History of teaching, the General Teaching 
                Council for Scotland (GTCS) and the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). After obtaining the PGDE, students are allocated to a school to 
                complete their initial teaching year as an Newly Qualified Teacher (NQT) where they work from provisional teacher registration to full 
                teacher registration and my initial teacher training probationary year was at <i>Penicuik High School</i> in Midlothian where, after an academic
                year, I gained full registration teacher status. The course nature proved incredibly demanding and challenged me in many ways including my confidence 
                in presentations and in speaking and my awareness of implementing a variety of pedagogical techniques to embed learning. </p>

        </div>
            <p>As an animal lover, I really enjoyed learning more about life and the natural world in this Degree. In year 1, my grades for 
              the mathematics modules where A in <b>Dealing with Data</b>, B in <b>Mathematics of Space and Change</b> and C in <b>Sequences and Patterns</b>, 
              gaining 60 MATH credits in total. In these years, I gained a further 40 BIOL credits through the <b>Biodiversity</b> and <b>Cells and Molecules</b>
             modules as well as 20 CHEM credits in I was awarded in the <b>Scientific Investigation</b> where I graded B1. In year 2, I achieved a futher 100 BIOL 
             credits in the <b>Introductory Microbiology</b>, <b>Genetics</b>, <b>Biosphere and Man</b>, <b>Human Biology</b>, <b>Vertebrate Physiology</b> and <b>
              Practical Skills in Biomedicine and Environmental Health</b> modules. In Year 3, I achieved a further 140 BIOL credits from the <b>Genetics</b>, <b>Work-Related 
                Learning</b>, <b>Animal Diversity</b>, <b>Bio-Professional Practice</b>, <b>Biological Conservation</b>, <b>Animal Behaviour</b> and <b>Entomology and 
                  Parasitology</b> modules. The course included a short but hands-on excursion to Millport where students boarded a trawler boat, collected marine wildlife 
                  and tested on their ability to identify and research a wide variety living species. The program also allowed for animal-related work experience 
                  as part of the Work-Related Learning module where I chose to volunteer at a seal rescue centre in Ireland for 10 days. More details of this can be found under
